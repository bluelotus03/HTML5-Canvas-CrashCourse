#### Interested in Different Effects?
👩‍💻 You can use the commits to test out the different effects we learned along the way in that course. There were some really fun things to play with and keep experimenting!  
  
📝 You'll also notice I took a lot of notes in the code comments. I like to document everything together, so feel free to take a look at those if they help you as well.
