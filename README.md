# [HTML5 Canvas Crash Course](https://youtu.be/Yvz_axxWG4Y)
Completed this course on an introduction to HTML5 Canvas from [Frank's Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/c/Frankslaboratory).

## 👉 [Try it out!](https://bluelotus03.github.io/HTML5-Canvas-CrashCourse/)
##### Note: To get the full effect, you need to view this on a desktop. Mobile view will let to tap to get some of the effect though!

#### Interested in Different Effects?
👩‍💻 You can use [the commits](https://github.com/bluelotus03/HTML5-Canvas-CrashCourse/commits/main) to test out the different effects we learned along the way in that course. There were some really fun things to play with and keep experimenting!  
  
📝 You'll also notice I took a lot of notes in the code comments. I like to document everything together, so feel free to take a look at those if they help you as well.
